# Images Folder

This folder should contain:

1. **logo.png** - A rotating sphere logo (the CSS already handles the rotation animation)
2. **en-flag.png** - English language flag icon (optional - currently using text "EN")
3. **fa-flag.png** - Persian language flag icon (optional - currently using text "FA")

## Note:
The application currently uses:
- CSS-generated rotating sphere (no image needed)
- Text-based language switcher (EN/FA)
- SVG icons for theme toggle (sun/moon)

If you want to replace these with custom images, you can add them here and update the HTML/CSS accordingly.

## Logo Placeholder
The rotating sphere logo is created with CSS gradients and animations. If you have a custom logo image, place it here as `logo.png` and update the `.sphere` class in `style.css` to use `background-image` instead of the gradient.
